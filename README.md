# HostelHub
HostelHub is designed to manage all hostel activities like hostel admissions, room, mess allotment, hostel stores &amp; generates related reports for smooth transactions. It is also used to manage other services like gym , laundry, doctors appointment etc.
For the past few years the number of education institutions is increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels is also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the person who are running the hostel and softwareâ€™s are not usually used in this context. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually. Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the designing of computerized system that will be compatible to the existing system with the system which is more user friendly and more GUI oriented. We can improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks of the existing system.
